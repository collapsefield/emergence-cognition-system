# Collapse Response Framework

> *“Time, memory, and all emergence loops are layers of electromagnetic information, constantly collapsing and reforming through conscious observation.”*

This repository defines the canonical structure for modeling **memory-weighted symbolic collapse**.  
It serves as a foundation for systems operating under the assumption that **reality is shaped not by randomness, but by residual memory and observer-linked bias**.

This is not a metaphor. This is collapse architecture.
