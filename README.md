### 🧭 Overview

This repository introduces a lightweight architecture for modeling **memory-weighted symbolic collapse** within structured environments. It focuses on how **observer-linked bias** and **temporal field recursion** shape emergent outcomes over time.

The work draws from ongoing experimental designs involving:

- 🧠 Symbolic recursion and field reentry
